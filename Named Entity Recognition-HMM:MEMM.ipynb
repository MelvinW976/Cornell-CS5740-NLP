A primer on this task is provided further on.  We will treat this as a **sequence-tagging task**: for each token in the input text, assign one of the following 5 entity labels -- **ORG** (Organization), **PER** (Person), **LOC** (Location), **MISC** (Miscellaneous), and **O** (Not Named Entity) -- as well as a BIO-format prefix **B-** (token is the *beginning* of a named entity) or **I-** (token is *inside* a named entity). Overall, this yields 9 different labels: **B-ORG, I-ORG, B-PER, I-PER, B-LOC, I-LOC, B-MISC, I-MISC** and **O**.\n",

Build a Hidden Markov Model in accordance with the provided function headers. **You may NOT change the function specifications.** Please ensure that your code is clear, concise, and, most important of all, modular. This means you should break your implementation down into smaller functions or write it within a class. Please compute all probabilities in natural log when building the HMM.\n",

This process is commonly referred to as **decoding**. Bigram-based Viterbi is $ \\mathcal{O}(sm^2)$ where *s* is the length of the sentence and *m* is the number of tags. Your implementation should have similar efficiency. The code for this can be used later on for the MEMM too.\n",

In our version of unknown word handling, we simply decides all words occuring only one time in training set and its length larger than 12 as unknown words. However, there is not difference between these \"unknown\" word although we have assign them different \"BOI\" tag in our training data. In addition, with the logic to develop hmm model, transitive probability has a great impact on our prediction. With most of \"unknown\" words set as \"O\" (because most of words should be \"O\" as we all know), the hmm model will easily set the label of a unknown word as \"O\".\n",
